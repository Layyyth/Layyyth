#  About Me:
I'm Layth, a Software Engineer with a passion for building clean, scalable systems and solving real world problems through code.<br><br>My work spans across backend development, machine learning. Whether it's designing robust APIs, optimizing models, or structuring systems from the ground up, I approach every project with clarity, precision, and a drive to learn.<br><br>This GitHub is a collection of what I build, break, and rebuild. Some of itâ€™s polished, some of itâ€™s in progress, but all of it reflects how I think and grow as a developer.<br><br>If you're browsing through my work, I hope you find something interesting, useful, or at the very least, thoughtfully built.<br><br>Feel free to explore the repos, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.<br>
